# Codveda Technologies Internship - Machine Learning Proficiency Tasks

This repository contains machine learning tasks designed to demonstrate proficiency across three levels: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced. Each level focuses on different aspects of machine learning, using provided datasets.

## Levels and Tasks

### Beginner Level: Supervised Learning Task
- **Folder**: Supervised_Learning_Task
- **Focus**: Classification and regression using labeled data.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Iris flower classification using KNN.
  - House price prediction (regression).
  - Customer churn prediction (classification).
- **Datasets Used**: iris.csv, house Prediction Data Set.csv, churn-bigml-20.csv, churn-bigml-80.csv

### Intermediate Level: Unsupervised Learning Task
- **Folder**: Unsupervised_Learning_Task
- **Focus**: Discovering patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Clustering on Iris dataset.
  - Dimensionality reduction on stock prices.
  - Topic modeling on sentiment data.
- **Datasets Used**: iris.csv, Stock Prices Data Set.csv, Sentiment dataset.csv

### Advanced Level: Deep Learning Task
- **Folder**: Deep_Learning_Task
- **Focus**: Building and training neural networks.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Sentiment analysis with neural networks.
  - Time series forecasting for stock prices.
  - Deep classification models.
- **Datasets Used**: Sentiment dataset.csv, Stock Prices Data Set.csv, iris.csv, churn-bigml-20.csv, churn-bigml-80.csv

## Setup Instructions

1. **Virtual Environment**: A virtual environment (.venv) is already set up and activated in the workspace.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all required libraries.
3. **Datasets**: All datasets are located in the `Data Set For Tasks/Data Set For Task/` folder.
4. **Running Tasks**: Each task folder contains a README with specific instructions. Use Jupyter notebooks for implementation where applicable.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Libraries listed in requirements.txt (includes NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)

## Evaluation
Tasks should include data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualizations. Document your approach and results in the respective folders.

For any questions, refer to the task-specific READMEs.
